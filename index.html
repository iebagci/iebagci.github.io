                        HMGCC]<br>
                        Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a new type of communication system that is useful for a
                        number of applications. For example, a WSN can be used to build a physical intrusion detection
                        system. If unauthorized access is detected personnel can be informed about the intrusion or,
                        alternatively, the WSN can interact directly with other systems to respond to the incident.
                        However, before a WSN can be used in practice it must be ensured that the WSN can be operated
                        securely. The WSN must be able to handle and withstand attacks. However, the threat to a WSN is
                        generally not constant. The threat situation may differ from one application scenario to the
                        next and threat levels change over time. Therefore, it is necessary to use adaptive security
                        mechanisms that can be tailored to the currently experienced threat level. To allow for such
                        adaptation it must also be possible to monitor and identify the current threat level. The goal
                        of this research project is to develop a risk management strategy for WSNs comprising adaptive
                        security mechanisms and threat monitoring methods.

                                Authentication is an essential cryptographic primitive that confirms the identity of
                                parties during communications. For security, it is important that these identities are
                                complex, in order to make them difficult to clone or guess. In recent years, physically
                                unclonable functions (PUFs) have emerged, in which identities are embodied in
                                structures, rather than stored in memory elements. PUFs provide “digital fingerprints,”
                                where information is usually read from the static entropy of a system, rather than
                                having an identity artificially programmed in, preventing a malicious party from making
                                a copy for nefarious use later on. Many concepts for the physical source of the
                                uniqueness of these PUFs have been developed for multiple different applications. While
                                certain types of PUF have received a great deal of attention, other promising
                                suggestions may be overlooked. To remedy this, we present a review that seeks to
                                exhaustively catalogue and provide a complete organisational scheme towards the
                                suggested concepts for PUFs. Furthermore, by carefully considering the physical
                                mechanisms underpinning the operation of different PUFs, we are able to form
                                relationships between PUF technologies that previously had not been linked and look
                                toward novel forms of PUF using physical principles that have yet to be exploited.

                                Resonant-Tunnelling Diodes (RTDs) have been proposed as building blocks for Physical
                                Unclonable Functions (PUFs). In this paper we show how the unique RTD current-voltage
                                (I-V) spectrum can be translated into a robust digital representation. We analyse 130
                                devices and show that RTDs are a viable PUF building block.

                                We report the first active acoustic side-channel attack. Speakers are used to emit human
                                inaudible acoustic signals and the echo is recorded via microphones, turning the
                                acoustic system of a smart phone into a sonar system. The echo signal can be used to
                                profile user interaction with the device. For example, a victim's finger movements can
                                be inferred to steal Android phone unlock patterns. In our empirical study, the number
                                of candidate unlock patterns that an attacker must try to authenticate herself to a
                                Samsung S4 Android phone can be reduced by up to 70% using this novel acoustic
                                side-channel. Our approach can be easily applied to other application scenarios and
                                device types. Overall, our work highlights a new family of security threats.

                                Random number generation is crucial in many aspects of everyday life, as online security
                                and privacy depend ultimately on the quality of random numbers. Many current
                                implementations are based on pseudo-random number generators, but information security
                                requires true random numbers for sensitive applications like key generation in banking,
                                defence or even social media. True random number generators are systems whose outputs
                                cannot be determined, even if their internal structure and response history are known.
                                Sources of quantum noise are thus ideal for this application due to their intrinsic
                                uncertainty. In this work, we propose using resonant tunnelling diodes as practical true
                                random number generators based on a quantum mechanical effect. The output of the
                                proposed devices can be directly used as a random stream of bits or can be further
                                distilled using randomness extraction algorithms, depending on the application.

                                Modern technology unintentionally provides resources that enable the trust of everyday
                                interactions to be undermined. Some authentication schemes address this issue using
                                devices that give a unique output in response to a challenge. These signatures are
                                generated by hard-to-predict physical responses derived from structural characteristics,
                                which lend themselves to two different architectures, known as unique objects (UNOs) and
                                physically unclonable functions (PUFs). The classical design of UNOs and PUFs limits
                                their size and, in some cases, their security. Here we show that quantum confinement
                                lends itself to the provision of unique identities at the nanoscale, by using
                                fluctuations in tunnelling measurements through quantum wells in resonant tunnelling
                                diodes (RTDs). This provides an uncomplicated measurement of identity without
                                conventional resource limitations whilst providing robust security. The confined energy
                                levels are highly sensitive to the specific nanostructure within each RTD, resulting in
                                a distinct tunnelling spectrum for every device, as they contain a unique and
                                unpredictable structure that is presently impossible to clone. This new class of
                                authentication device operates with minimal resources in simple electronic structures
                                above room temperature.

                                Comprehensive security mechanisms are required for a successful implementation of the
                                Internet of Things (IoT). Existing solutions focus mainly on securing the communication
                                links between Internet hosts and IoT devices. However, as most IoT devices nowadays
                                provide vast amounts of flash storage space, it is as well required to consider storage
                                security within a comprehensive security framework. Instead of developing independent
                                security solutions for storage and communication, we propose Fusion, a framework that
                                provides coalesced confidential storage and communication. Fusion uses existing secure
                                communication protocols for the IoT such as Internet protocol security (IPsec) and
                                datagram transport layer security (DTLS) and re-uses the defined communication security
                                mechanisms within the storage component. Thus, trusted mechanisms developed for
                                communication security are extended into the storage space. Notably, this mechanism
                                allows us to transmit requested data directly from the file system without decrypting
                                read data blocks and then re-encrypting these for transmission. Thus, Fusion provides
                                benefits in terms of processing speed and energy efficiency, which are important aspects
                                for resource-constrained IoT devices. This paper describes the Fusion architecture and
                                its instantiation for IPsec-based and DTLS-based systems. We describe Fusion's
                                implementation and evaluate its storage overheads, communication performance, and energy
                                consumption.

                                In this paper we consider neighbor sensor networks which are defined as multiple
                                wireless sensor networks under the administration of different authorities but located
                                physically on the same area or close to each other. We construct a Linear Programming
                                framework to characterize the cooperation of neighbor sensor networks in comparison to
                                non-cooperating networks. We show that if neighbor sensor networks cooperate with each
                                other for relaying data packets then this cooperation brings two advantages as compared
                                to no cooperation case. First, lifetime of both networks is prolonged — the results of
                                our analysis show that cooperation between neighbor sensor networks can significantly
                                extend the overall network lifetime. Second, cooperation reduces the probability of
                                disjoint partitions arising due to the limited transmission ranges of sensor nodes. When
                                neighbor sensor networks cooperate, eliminating disjoint partitions is possible with
                                sensors having shorter transmission ranges as demonstrated and quantified by our
                                analysis.

                                In the context of wireless sensor networks, computation/communication tradeoffs may
                                appear in many aspects of the system design. In this paper, we present a linear
                                programming framework to guide designers in effectively using these tradeoffs for
                                prolonging network lifetime. To investigate the tradeoff in more concrete terms, as our
                                representative problem we choose a security service; non-repudiation which can be
                                supported with different types of digital signature algorithms. Since these algorithms
                                have high computation and/or communication overheads, supporting non-repudiation of
                                sensor data has been traditionally considered to be infeasible in wireless sensor
                                networks. Using our framework, we compare three signature algorithms with respect to
                                their effect on network lifetime in different topologies and operating conditions. We
                                have shown that with proper algorithm selection the lifetime reduction due to the
                                utilization of digital signatures can be as low as 10%; however, non-optimal algorithm
                                selection can result in more than 90% lifetime reduction compared to a network not
                                supporting non-repudiation.

                                In wireless sensor networks (WSNs) contextual information such as the information
                                regarding whether, when, and where the data is collected cannot be protected using only
                                traditional measures (e.g., encryption). Contextual information can be protected against
                                global eavesdroppers by periodic packet transmission combined with dummy traffic
                                filtering at proxy nodes. In this paper, through a Linear Programming (LP) framework, we
                                analyze lifetime limits of WSNs preserving event-unobservability with different proxy

                                pass through multiple proxies that are organized as a general directed graph rather than
                                as a tree.

                                In wireless sensor networks an attack to the base station (sink) can render the whole
                                network useless. Hence, concealing the physical location of the sink may be necessary in
                                certain circumstances. Previous studies addressing this challenging problem assume a
                                weak adversary model. The problem has not been studied in the presence of an
                                eavesdropper who has global knowledge for the entire network. Here, a naive solution is
                                to employ fake sinks so that nodes send their data not only to the real sink but also to
                                other locations. An alternative solution with less overhead could be provided when all
                                nodes including base station equalize the values of their total incoming and outgoing
                                flows as well as their energy expenditure. This way, no information about the sink
                                location is revealed even when all communication within the network is monitored. In
                                this paper, through a Linear Programming (LP) framework we analyze and compare lifetime
                                limits of wireless sensor networks preserving sink location privacy with the
                                aforementioned two approaches.

                                In this paper we introduced a novel Linear Programming framework to model sensor network
                                lifetime when data reduction through compression is utilized. Comparative analysis of
                                three data compression and forwarding strategies show that neither data compression nor
                                flow balancing can achieve the maximal possible sensor network lifetime when optimized
                                independently. The comparisons reveal that jointly optimizing data compression and load
                                balancing results in up to an order of magnitude longer network lifetimes than
                                non-optimized data compression and load balancing.

                                In this letter, we present a Linear Programming framework for modeling dynamic data
                                compression and decompression in conjunction with flow balancing in wireless sensor
                                networks. Using the developed framework, we investigated the sensor network lifetimes
                                for different network sizes with various data compression and flow balancing strategies.
                                Our results show that neither compressing all data nor avoiding data compression
                                completely can achieve the longest possible network lifetime. Dynamic data
                                transformation is shown to achieve significantly longer network lifetimes than the
                                lifetimes obtained with the two pure strategies above.

                                A Unique Object (UNO) is a physical object with unique characteristics that can be
                                measured externally. The usually analogue measurement can be converted into a digital
                                representation - a fingerprint - which uniquely identifies the object. For practical
                                applications it is necessary that measurements can be performed without the need of
                                specialist equipment or complex measurement setup. Furthermore, a UNO should be able to
                                defeat simulation attacks; an attacker may replace the UNO with a device or system that
                                produces the expected measurement. Recently a novel type of UNOs based on Quantum Dots
                                (QDs) and exhibiting unique photo-luminescence properties has been proposed. The
                                uniqueness of these UNOs is based on quantum effects that can be interrogated using a
                                light source and a camera. The so called Quantum Confinement UNO (QCUNO) responds
                                uniquely to different light excitation levels which is exploited for simulation attack
                                protection, as opposed to focusing on features too small to reproduce and therefore
                                difficult to measure. In this paper we describe methods for extraction of fingerprints
                                from the QCUNO. We evaluate our proposed methods using 46 UNOs in a controlled setup.
                                Focus of the evaluation are entropy, error resilience and the ability to detect
                                simulation attacks.

                                Personal Voice Assistants (PVAs) such as the Siri, Amazon Echo and Google Home are now
                                commonplace. PVAs continuously monitor conversations which may be transported to a cloud
                                back end where they are stored, processed and maybe even passed on to other service
                                providers. A user has little control over this process. She is unable to control the
                                recording behaviour of surrounding PVAs, unable to signal her privacy requirements to
                                back-end systems and unable to track conversation recordings. In this paper we explore
                                techniques for embedding additional information into acoustic signals processed by PVAs.
                                A user employs a tagging device which emits an acoustic signal when PVA activity is
                                assumed. Any active PVA will embed this tag into their recorded audio stream. The tag
                                may signal a cooperating PVA or back-end system that a user has not given a recording
                                consent. The tag may also be used to trace when and where a recording was taken. We
                                discuss different tagging techniques and application scenarios, and we describe the
                                implementation of a prototype tagging device based on PocketSphinx. Using the popular
                                PVA Google Home Mini we demonstrate that the device can tag conversations and that the
                                tagging signal can be retrieved from conversations stored in the Google back-end system.

                                Personal Voice Assistants (PVAs) such as the Amazon Echo are commonplace and it is now
                                likely to always be in range of at least one PVA. Although the devices are very helpful
                                they are also continuously monitoring conversations. When a PVA detects a wake word, the
                                immediately following conversation is recorded and transported to a cloud system for
                                further analysis. In this paper we investigate an active protection mechanism against
                                PVAs: reactive jamming. A Protection Jamming Device (PJD) is employed to observe
                                conversations. Upon detection of a PVA wake word the PJD emits an acoustic jamming
                                signal. The PJD must detect the wake word faster than the PVA such that the jamming
                                signal still prevents wake word detection by the PVA. The paper presents an evaluation
                                of the effectiveness of different jamming signals. We quantify the impact of jamming
                                signal and wake word overlap on jamming success. Furthermore, we quantify the jamming
                                false positive rate in dependence of the overlap. Our evaluation shows that a 100%
                                jamming success can be achieved with an overlap of at least 60% with a negligible false
                                positive rate. Thus, reactive jamming of PVAs is feasible without creating a system
                                perceived as a noise nuisance.

                                The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly used for critical applications and securing
                                the IoT has become a major concern. Among other issues it is important to ensure that
                                tampering with IoT devices is detected. Many IoT devices use WiFi for communication and
                                Channel State Information (CSI) based tamper detection is a valid option. Each 802.11n
                                WiFi frame contains a preamble which allows a receiver to estimate the impact of the
                                wireless channel, the transmitter and the receiver on the signal. The estimation result
                                - the CSI - is used by a receiver to extract the transmitted information. However, as
                                the CSI depends on the communication environment and the transmitter hardware, it can be
                                used as well for security purposes. If an attacker tampers with a transmitter it will
                                have an effect on the CSI measured at a receiver. Unfortunately not only tamper events
                                lead to CSI fluctuations; movement of people in the communication environment has an
                                impact too. We propose to analyse CSI values of a transmission simultaneously at
                                multiple receivers to improve distinction of tamper and movement events. A moving person
                                is expected to have an impact on some but not all communication links between
                                transmitter and the receivers. A tamper event impacts on all links between transmitter
                                and the receivers. The paper describes the necessary algorithms for the proposed tamper
                                detection method. In particular we analyse the tamper detection capability in practical
                                deployments with varying intensity of people movement. In our experiments the proposed
                                system deployed in a busy office environment was capable to detect 53% of tamper events
                                (TPR = 53%) while creating zero false alarms (FPR = 0%).

                                Wireless devices are often used in application scenarios with strict security
                                requirements. Examples are physical intrusion detection systems commonly used to protect
                                factories, airports or government buildings. In such scenarios, additional security
                                features such as tamper detection are highly desirable to complement traditional
                                cryptographic mechanisms. In this paper we use channel state information (CSI),
                                extracted from off-the-shelf 802.11n Wi-Fi cards, to calculate a tamper-evidence value
                                for transmitters. This value enables detection of tampering due to device movement or
                                replacement. We describe algorithms for tamper-evidence value computation, discuss the
                                interpretation of this value and evaluate its effectiveness.

                                Clocks on wireless sensor nodes experience a natural drift. This clock skew is unique
                                for each node as it depends on the clocks manufacturing characteristics. Clock skew can
                                be used as unique node identifier which is, among other applications, useful for node
                                authentication. We describe how clock skew of a node's clock can be measured directly on
                                a node by utilising the available high precision radio transceiver clock. We detail an
                                implementation of this proposed local clock skew tracking method for the Zolertia Z1
                                platform. We determine the required sampling effort to accurately determine clock skew.
                                We also discuss how clock skew measurements can be aligned with existing transceiver
                                operations in order to avoid an increase in energy consumption.

                                The future Internet of Things (IoT) may be based on the existing and established
                                Internet Protocol (IP). Many IoT application scenarios will handle sensitive data.
                                However, as security requirements for storage and communication are addressed
                                separately, work such as key management or cryptographic processing is duplicated. In
                                this paper we present a framework that allows us to combine secure storage and secure
                                communication in the IP-based IoT. We show how data can be stored securely such that it
                                can be delivered securely upon request without further cryptographic processing. Our
                                prototype implementation shows that combined secure storage and communication can reduce
                                the security-related processing on nodes by up to 71% and energy consumption by up to
                                32.1%.

                                A plethora of communication protocols for home automation are currently in use. These
                                protocols generally lack essential security features such as message authentication.
                                Thus, smart homes are not protected against accidental or malicious message injection.
                                In this paper we describe how jamming can be used to prevent processing of unsolicited
                                messages in smart homes. We describe how jamming based protection can be added to a home
                                automation system without impairing legitimate transmissions in neighbouring houses.
                                Furthermore, we present the initial evaluation of a jamming device and its capability to
                                secure networks of a variety of protocol types. Our evaluation shows that even a single
                                jamming device can significantly improve the security of a smart home.

                                Many Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are used to collect and process conﬁdential
                                information. Conﬁdentiality must be ensured at all times and, for example, solutions for
                                conﬁdential communication, processing or storage are required. To date, the research
                                community has addressed mainly the issue of conﬁdential communication. Efﬁcient
                                solutions for cryptographically secured communication and associated key exchange in
                                WSNs exist. Many WSN applications, however, rely heavily on available on-node storage
                                space and therefore it is essential to ensure the conﬁdentiality of stored data as well.
                                In this paper we present Codo, a conﬁdential data storage solution which balances
                                platform, performance and security requirements. We implement Codo for the Contiki WSN
                                operating system and evaluate its performance.

                                In this work, we design and implement a strong physical uncloneable function from an
                                array of individual resonant tunnelling diodes that were previously described to have a
                                unique response when challenged. The system demonstrates the exponential scalability of
                                its responses when compared to the number of devices present in the system, with an
                                expected large set of responses while retaining a 1:1 relationship with challenges.
                                Using a relatively small set of 16 devices, 256 responses are shown to have promising
                                levels of distinctness and repeatability through multiple measurements.

                                Wireless sensors and actuators are increasingly used to automate residential properties.
                                Such home automation (HA) systems are generally built around simple devices and network
                                protocols in order to keep system complexity and prices low. Nearly all used protocols
                                do not provide any security mechanisms and it is possible to inject messages
                                accidentally or on purpose. As it is not feasible to upgrade already deployed devices or
                                to simply re-design the used protocols it is desirable to find a protection mechanism
                                that can be used to augment existing systems. We propose to use jamming in order to
                                prevent unsolicited messages from reaching devices in home automation systems. We
                                demonstrate a jamming device that can be used to augment HA systems to add an additional
                                layer of protection. The device can be integrated into existing home automation systems.
